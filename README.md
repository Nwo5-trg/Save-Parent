# Save Parent
Paste with group parent and build helper with parent :3

## How to use
***This mod rewrites build helper completely (to work in ascending order and with parents) but if you dont want that (or some mod incompat makes it not work) you can just disable it in settings.***

This mod adds 2 new buttons to the editor pause guidelines menu. (so like where the better edit button is if you use that)

The pink button lets you toggle pasting with parent.

The cyan button duplicates your selection with build helper. (always saves group parent)
